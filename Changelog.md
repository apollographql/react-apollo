### Bug Fixes

- Invoke `onCompleted`/`onError` even if `Mutation` unmounts. <br/>
  [PR #2710](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2710)

### Improvements

- Update the typescript example app to use the raw Query component directly,
  with generics, to avoid generating the extra object that's created (in the
  compiled code) when extending the Query component as a class.  <br/>
  [@evans](https://github.com/evans) in [#2721](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2721)

- Use new `ApolloClient#stop` method to dispose of `MockedProvider` client
  instance.  <br/>
  [PR #2741](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2741)

- The `apollo-client` peer dependency version constraint has been updated
  to require the latest version, 2.4.12. Although this update is
  recommended, and we believe it is backwards compatible with other
  apollo-client@2.4.x versions, we decided to bump the minor version of
  `react-apollo` (to 2.4.0) because of this new `apollo-client` version
  requirement.

## 2.3.3

### Bug Fixes

- Add `react-dom` as a peer dependency (since it's used by `getDataFromTree`
  and `renderToStringWithData`).  <br/>
  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2660](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2660)

### Improvements

- Drop `react` 14.x support, since the 14.x release line is 2 years old now,
  and `react-apollo` is no longer tested against it.  <br/>
  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2660](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2660)

## 2.3.2

### Improvements

### Bug Fixes

- This package no longer imports `react-dom/server` unconditionally at the
  top level, making `react-apollo` safer to use in environments like React
  Native that are neither browser-like nor Node-like, and thus struggle to
  import `react-dom/server` and its dependencies. Additionally, the React
  Native bundler has been instructed to ignore all `react-dom/server`
  dependencies within `react-apollo`, so `react-dom` will not be bundled
  in React Native apps simply because they import `react-apollo`.
  [PR #2627](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2627)

## 2.3.1 (November 15, 2018)

### Improvements

- Restore original `getDataFromTree(tree, context)` API, and introduce a
  new alternative called `getMarkupFromTree` to enable custom rendering
  functions:
  ```typescript
  export default function getDataFromTree(
    tree: React.ReactNode,
    context: { [key: string]: any } = {},
  ) {
    return getMarkupFromTree({
      tree,
      context,
      renderFunction: renderToStaticMarkup,
    });
  }

  export type GetMarkupFromTreeOptions = {
    tree: React.ReactNode;
    context?: { [key: string]: any };
    renderFunction?: typeof renderToStaticMarkup;
  };

  export function getMarkupFromTree({
    tree,
    context = {},
    renderFunction = renderToStaticMarkup,
  }: GetMarkupFromTreeOptions): Promise<string> {...}
  ```
  [PR #2586](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2586)

### Bug Fixes

- Version 2.3.0 was published incorrectly, breaking nested
  `react-apollo/...` imports. This problem was fixed in version 2.3.1 by
  running `npm publish` from the `lib/` directory, as intended.
  [Issue #2591](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/2591)

## 2.3.0

### Bug Fixes

- Fix `networkStatus` to reflect the loading state correctly for partial
  refetching.  <br/>
  [@steelbrain](https://github.com/steelbrain) in [#2493](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2493)

### Improvements

- Reimplement `getDataFromTree` using `ReactDOM.renderToStaticMarkup` to
  make asynchronous server-side rendering compatible with
  [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
  Although the rendering function used by `getDataFromTree` defaults to
  `renderToStaticMarkup`, any suitable rendering function can be passed as
  the optional second argument to `getDataFromTree`, which now returns a
  `Promise<string>` that resolves to The HTML rendered in the final pass,
  which means calling `renderToString` after `getDataFromTree` may not be
  necessary anymore.
  [PR #2533](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2533)

## 2.2.4 (October 2, 2018)

### Bug Fixes

- `lodash.isequal` was improperly set as a dev dependency for
  `MockLink` / `MockedProvider`. It is now a dependency. <br/>
  [@danilobuerger](https://github.com/danilobuerger) in [#2449](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2449)

### Improvements

- The `Subscription` component now accepts a `fetchPolicy` prop. <br/>
  [@MatthieuLemoine](https://github.com/MatthieuLemoine) in [#2298](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2298)

### Typescript

- Make sure the `TVariables` generic is passed to `ObservableQuery`. <br/>
  [@tgriesser](https://github.com/tgriesser) in [#2311](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2311)

## 2.2.3 (September 30, 2018)

### Bug Fixes

- Mutation errors are now properly returned as a render prop, when using
  a default `errorPolicy` of `all`. <br/>
  [@amacleay](https://github.com/amacleay) in [#2374](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2374)
- `<Mutation />` `refetchQueries` triggered by name (string) will now use the correct variables. <br/>
  [@fracmal](https://github.com/fracmak) in [#2422](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2422)

### Improvements

- Replace the `lodash` dependency with `lodash.flowright` (since that's the
  only non-dev `lodash` function we're dependent on). Dev `lodash`
  dependencies have also been updated to use their individual module
  equivalent. <br/>
  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2435](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2435)
- Removed `rollup-plugin-babel-minify` as it's no longer being used. <br/>
  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2436](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2436)
- Small `getDataFromTree.ts` logic adjustment to avoid unnecessary calls
  when a falsy `element` is encountered. <br/>
  [@HOUCe](https://github.com/HOUCe) in [#2429](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2429)
- `graphql` 14 updates. <br/>
  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2437](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2437)
- All example apps (included in the repo) have been updated to work with the
  latest version of React Apollo. <br/>
  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2439](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2439)

### Typescript

- Fix `lodash` typings. <br/>
  [@williamboman](https://github.com/williamboman) in [#2430](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2430)
- Typings: added `context` to `MutationOptions`. <br/>
  [@danilobuerger](https://github.com/danilobuerger) in [#2354](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2354)
- Typings: more `MutationOptions` changes/fixes. <br/>
  [@danilobuerger](https://github.com/danilobuerger) in [#2340](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pul/2340)
- Remove `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` use. Typescript's
  `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` compiler option is something we'd like to
  start using, but we jumped the gun a bit by introducing it in
  https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/commit/9a96519d390783dfd9a431dc2dbaa476a24f7b80.
  Including it means that anyone who wants to use Typescript with React
  Apollo would have to also include it in their own local `tsconfig.json`, to
  be able to handle default imports properly. This is because we're also using
  Typescript's `es2015` `module` option, which means
  `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` has to be enabled explicitly. We've
  switched back to using a combination of `import * as X` and `require`
  syntax, to work with default imports. We'll re-introduce
  `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` use in React Apollo 3. <br/>
  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2438](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2438)

## 2.2.2 (September 28, 2018)

- When using `React.createContext` and SSR, we now make sure the context
  provider value is reset to the previous value it had after its children are
  walked. <br/>
  [@mitchellhamilton](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton) in [#2304](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2304)
- Revert: <br/>
  When a query failed on the first result, the query result `data` was being
  returned as `undefined`. This behavior has been changed so that `data` is
  returned as an empty object. This makes checking for data (e.g.
  instead of `data && data.user` you can just check `data.user`) and
  destructring (e.g. `{ data: { user } }`) easier. **Note:** this could
  potentially hurt applications that are relying on a falsey check of `data`
  to see if any query errors have occurred. A better (and supported) way to
  check for errors is to use the result `errors` property. <br/>
  [#1983](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1983)

## 2.2.1 (September 26, 2018)

- Revert: "Typescript: use `Partial<TData>` instead of `TData | {}`, for the
  `QueryResult` `data` property."

## 2.2.0 (September 26, 2018)

- Improved TypeScript Typings:
  Deprecated `MutationFunc` in favor of `MutationFn`.
  Added missing `onCompleted` and `onError` callbacks to `MutationOpts`. <br/>
  [@danilobuerger](https://github.com/danilobuerger) in [#2322](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2322)
- Added an example app that shows how to test mutations. <br/>
  [@excitement-engineer](https://github.com/excitement-engineer) in [#1998](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1998)
- The `<Subscription />` component now allows the registration of a callback
  function, that will be triggered each time the component receives data. The
  callback `options` object param consists of the current Apollo Client
  instance in `client`, and the received subscription data in
  `subscriptionData`. <br/>
  [@jedwards1211](https://github.com/jedwards1211) in [#1966](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1966)
- The `graphql` `options` object is no longer mutated, when calculating
  variables from props. This now prevents an issue where components created
  with `graphql` were not having their query variables updated properly, when
  props changed. <br/>
  [@ksmth](https://github.com/ksmth) in [#1968](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1968)
- When a query failed on the first result, the query result `data` was being
  returned as `undefined`. This behavior has been changed so that `data` is
  returned as an empty object. This makes checking for data (e.g.
  instead of `data && data.user` you can just check `data.user`) and
  destructring (e.g. `{ data: { user } }`) easier. **Note:** this could
  potentially hurt applications that are relying on a falsey check of `data`
  to see if any query errors have occurred. A better (and supported) way to
  check for errors is to use the result `errors` property. <br/>
  [@TLadd](https://github.com/TLadd) in [#1983](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1983)
- Allow a custom `cache` object to be passed into the test-utils
  `MockedProvider`. <br/>
  [@palmfjord](https://github.com/palmfjord) in [#2254](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2254)
- Make the `MockedProvider` `mocks` prop read only. <br/>
  [@amacleay](https://github.com/amacleay) in [#2284](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2284)
- Remove duplicate `FetchMoreOptions` and `FetchMoreQueryOptions` types, and
  instead import them from Apollo Client. <br/>
  [@skovy](https://github.com/skovy) in [#2281](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2281)
- Type changes for the `graphql` HOC `options.skip` property. <br/>
  [@jameslaneconkling](https://github.com/jameslaneconkling) in [#2208](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2208)
- Avoid importing `lodash` directly. <br/>
  [@shahyar](https://github.com/shahyar) in [#2045](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2045)
- When the `Query` `skip` prop is set to `true`, make sure the render prop
  `loading` param is set to `false`, since we're not actually loading
  anything. <br/>
  [@edorivai](https://github.com/edorivai) in [#1916](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1916)
- No longer building against Node 9 <br/>
  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2404](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2404)
- Make sure `<Subscription />`, `<Query />` & `<Mutation />` all support
  using an Apollo Client instance configured in the `context` or via
  props. <br/>
  [@quentin-](https://github.com/quentin-) in [#1956](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1956)
- Typescript: use `Partial<TData>` instead of `TData | {}`, for the
  `QueryResult` `data` property. <br/>
  [@tgriesser](https://github.com/tgriesser) in [#2313](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2313)
- Adjust `<Query />` `onCompleted` and `onError` callbacks to be triggered
  via the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method. This ensures these callbacks
  can be used when data is fetched over the network, and when data is
  fetched from the local store (previsouly these callbacks were only being
  triggered when data was fetched over the network).
  [@olistic](https://github.com/olistic) in [#2190](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2190)
- Import `lodash/flowRight` using ES import to allow for treeshaking. <br/>
  [@Pajn](https://github.com/Pajn) in [#2332](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2332)
- Fixed a regression where `variables` passed in `graphql` HOC `options` were
  not merged with mutation `variables`. <br/>
  [@samginn](https://github.com/samginn) in [#2216](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2216)
- Added a new `partialRefetch` prop (`false` by default).
  When a `Query` component is mounted, and a mutation is executed
  that returns the same ID as the mounted `Query`, but has less
  fields in its result, Apollo Client's `QueryManager` returns the
  data as an empty Object since a hit can't be found in the cache.
  This can lead to application errors when the UI elements rendered by
  the original `Query` component are expecting certain data values to
  exist, and they're all of a sudden stripped away. The recommended way to
  handle this is to use the mutations `update` prop to reconcile the mutation
  result with the data in the cache, getting everything into the expected
  state. This can definitely be a cumbersome process however, so to help
  address this the `partialRefetch` prop can be used to automatically
  `refetch` the original query and update the cache. <br/>
  [@steelbrain](https://github.com/steelbrain) in [#2003](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2003)

## 2.1.11 (August 9, 2018)

- Fixed an issue in `getDataFromTree` where queries that threw more than one
  error had error messages swallowed, and returned an invalid error object
  with circular references. Multiple errors are now preserved. <br/>
  [@anand-sundaram-zocdoc](https://github.com/anand-sundaram-zocdoc) in [#2133](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2133)
- Update both the `<Mutation />` component and `graphql` HOC to accept a new
  `awaitRefetchQueries` prop (boolean). When set to `true`, queries specified
  in `refetchQueries` will be completed before the mutation itself is
  completed. `awaitRefetchQueries` is `false` by default, which means
  `refetchQueries` are usually completed after the mutation has resolved.
  Relates to Apollo Client. <br/>
  [PR #3169](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3169). <br/>
  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2214](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2214)
- Typings adjustment: pass `TData` along into `MutationUpdaterFn` when using
  `MutationOpts`, to ensure that the updater function is properly typed. <br/>
  [@danilobuerger](https://github.com/danilobuerger) in [#2227](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2227)
- Check if queryManager is set before accessing it. <br/>
  [@danilobuerger](https://github.com/danilobuerger) in [#2165](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2165)

## 2.1.9 (July 4, 2018)

- Added `onCompleted` and `onError` props to the `Query` component, than can
  be used to register callback functions that are to be executed after a
  query successfully completes, or an error occurs.
  [@jeshep](https://github.com/jeshep) in [#1922](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1922)
- Add `UNSAFE_componentWillMount` SSR support.
  [@leops](https://github.com/leops) in [#2152](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2152)
- Clear out scheduler on MockedProvider unmount.
  [@danilobuerger](https://github.com/danilobuerger) in [#2151](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2151)

## 2.1.8 (June 28, 2018)

- Addressed deployment issue.

## 2.1.7 (June 27, 2018)

- The `ApolloProvider` `children` prop type has been changed from `element`
  to `node`, to allow multiple children.
  [@quentin-](https://github.com/quentin-) in [#1955](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1955)
- Properly support the new `getDerivedStateFromProps` lifecycle method.
  [@amannn](https://github.com/amannn) in [#2076](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2076)
- `lodash` is no longer pinned to version 4.17.10.
  [@cherewaty](https://github.com/cherewaty) in [#1951](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1951)
- README updates to replace `apollo-client-preset` with `apollo-boost`.
  [@JamesTheHacker](https://github.com/JamesTheHacker) in [#1925](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1925)
- README updates to fix broken links.
  [@DennisKo](https://github.com/DennisKo) in [#1935](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1935)
- Project README has been updated to show a `<Query />` example.
  [@petetnt](https://github.com/petetnt) in [#2102](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2102)

## 2.1.6 (June 19, 2018)

- Adjust `getDataFromTree` to properly traverse React 16.3's context API
  provider/consumer approach.
  [@marnusw](https://github.com/marnusw) in [#1978](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1978)
- An `ApolloClient` instance can now be passed into a `Mutation`
  component via a prop named `client`. This prop will override
  an `ApolloClient` instance set via `context`, by the `ApolloProvider`
  component.
  [@amneacsu](https://github.com/amneacsu) in [#1890](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1890)
- The `ApolloClient` instance used by a Mutation is now available in that
  Mutation's result.
  [PR #1945](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1945)
  [@cooperka](https://github.com/cooperka) in [#1945](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1945)

  - Add `<ApolloConsumer />` component [#1399](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1399) [#1484](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1484)
  - Added support for Preact when using `getDataFromTree` [#1561](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1561)

- **BREAKING CHANGES [Removal of deprecated code]**

  - Remove deprecated `operationOptions.options.skip`, use `operationOptions.skip` instead
  - Remove deprecated [`options.updateQueries`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/basics/mutations.html#graphql-mutation-options-updateQueries), use [`options.update`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/basics/mutations.html#graphql-mutation-options-update) instead [#1485](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1485)

- **BREAKING CHANGES [TypeScript and Flow only]**

  - typescript - `graphql` parameterized types streamlined for
    a) full typing; and b) ease of use; and c) consistency. New parameterized is:
    `graphql<TProps,TData, TGraphQLVariables, TChildProps>` where none are required and full typing only requires the
    first three params (`TChildProps` can be derived). [#1402](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1402)
