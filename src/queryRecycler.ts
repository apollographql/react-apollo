/**
 * An observable query recycler stores some observable queries that are no
 * longer in use, but that we may someday use again.
 *
 * Recycling observable queries avoids a few unexpected functionalities that
 * may be hit when using the `react-apollo` API. Namely not updating queries
 * when a component unmounts, and calling reducers/`updateQueries` more times
 * then is necessary for old observable queries.
 *
 * We assume that the GraphQL document for every `ObservableQuery` is the same.
 *
 * For more context on why this was added and links to the issues recycling
 * `ObservableQuery`s fixes see issue [#462][1].
 *
